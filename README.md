# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This is a group project where we are working on a Kaggle credit card dataset with 3 lakh rows and 122 features. We are using data mining concepts to first clean the data, then implementing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find meaningful insights and features highly affecting the target variable. Machine Learning models for classfication problem such as this one like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forest, etc. will also be applied to build a model which accurately predicts if a loan should be sanctioned to a new customer or not.
